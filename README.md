# dotfiles
Dotfiles for my Arch Linux WM, compositor, bar, etc. setup.

I took a lot of inspiration from [lamalunderscore's dotfiles](https://github.com/lamalunderscore/dotfiles), so check those out too.

## rofi
Almost all of the rofi configs are directly taken from [adi1090x's rofi repository](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi), apart from a few minor modifications I made, like the [black.rasi theme for the powermenu](../blob/main/rofi/powermenu/styles/black.rasi) that I adapted from that of the text launcher in the original repo.
